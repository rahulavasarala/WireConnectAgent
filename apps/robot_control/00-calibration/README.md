# 00-force_calibration

Force sensor calibration to determine load mass, load center of mass, and force sensor bias.
Force sensor readings and force sensor orientations are collected at various configurations,
and a non-linear optimization problem is solved to minimize the error between measurements and 
estimated load values.
